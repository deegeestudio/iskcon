						<h2 class="mb-5 mt-5">History of Hare Krishna Movement</h2>

						<p>
							In 1965, at the age of 69, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada boarded the steamship ‘Jaladuta’ from Mumbai on his way to United States. At an age when most people think of retiring Srila Prabhupada undertook this arduous journey to fulfill the mission of Lord Caitanya and follow the instruction of his spiritual master Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur to carry the message of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam to Western world.
						</p>
						<p>
						After arriving in New York City in September 1965, Srila Prabhupada struggled alone for the first year to establish his Krishna conscious movement. He lived simply, lectured whenever and wherever he got the opportunity and gradually began to attract some small interest in his teaching. In July of 1966, while still working from an obscure storefront on New York City’s Lower East Side, Srila Prabhupada nonetheless founded a spiritual society intended for worldwide participation. He called it International Society for Krishna Consciousness or ISKCON for short and thus began the Hare Krishna movement in America.</p>
						<p>
						At the time of incorporation, Srila Prabhupada had not attracted even one committed follower. Undeterred, he enlisted volunteers from among the small group of regular attendees at his evening lectures to act as ISKCON’s first trustees. That was then. Today, ISKCON comprises of more than 400 temples worldwide, 40 rural communities and over 100 vegetarian restaurants. It also conducts special projects throughout the world, such as “Food for Life”, the only free vegetarian relief program in the world.

						<h2 class="section_title mb-5 text-center">ISKCON Mayapur</h2>

						<p>
							Mayapur is situated at the confluence of river Jalangi and the Ganga. It is located about 130 kms north of Kolkata within Nadia district, West Bengal. It is the global headquarters of ISKCON and is considered one of the most Holy places in India. Mayapur is the birthplace of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, an expansion of Lord Krishna.

						</p>
						<p> 
							Srila Prabhupada, who came to Mayapur with nothing, founded the project in the early 1970’s. Srila Prabhupada initially lived in a simple bhajan kutir for some time, and then the Lotus Building was built, becoming the first building constructed in ISKCON. Since that time, through the vision of Srila Prabhupada and the hard work of countless devotees, the project has grown to encompass many areas of devotional service, including the beautiful forms of Sri Sri Radha-Madhava and their (eight) asta-sakhis, Sri Sri Pancha-Tattva, and Sri Sri Prahlada-Nrsimhadeva. </p>

						<h2 class="section_title mb-5 ">International Society for <br> Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)</h2>

						<p>
							International Society for Krishna Consciousness, also popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement is a spiritual society founded by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in July 1966 in New York. ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradaya, a monotheistic tradition within Vedic culture. Today ISKCON comprises of more than 400 temples, 40 rural communities and over 100 vegetarian restaurants. It also conducts special projects throughout the world, such as “Food for Life”, the only free vegetarian relief program in the world.
						</p>
						<p>  The aim of ISKCON is to acquaint all people of world with universal principles of self-realization and God consciousness so that they may derive the highest benefit of spiritual understanding, unity and peace.</p>
						<p>
							The Vedic literature recommend that in the present age of Kali-yuga the most effective means of achieving self-realization is always hear about, glorify, and remember the all-attractive Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. Therefore, it recommends the chanting of the Holy Names: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare / Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. This sublime chanting puts the chanter directly in touch with the Supreme Lord through the sound vibration of His Holy Name.
